# getx

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In This Project I have discuss about getx state management.
I have used getxController Class for the updation of the variable.
For example, I have created Circular avatar which is created using listview widget, when I clicked on it the color will be changed and other circular avatar color will be same.
